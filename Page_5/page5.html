        <h2 class="Porsche_Regular">2011 - 2018</h2> <!-- Subheadings -->

        <p class="intro-text"> <!-- Paragraphs -->
            Units Produced: 233,540. <br> <br> Launched in 2011, the Porsche 991 heralded a new era for the 911 series, being praised as one of the prettiest iterations in recent decades. Despite its aesthetic accolades, the introduction of electric steering faced its share of criticism, marking a significant shift in driving dynamics that stirred passionate debates among purists. Nevertheless, the 991 offered a plethora of features and improvements that captivated enthusiasts and critics alike.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The Carrera models of the 991 generation embraced a round-edged GT car character, showcasing a blend of sophistication and performance that had not been seen before. This generation also elevated performance to new heights with the introduction of the GT3 RS, known for its sheer savagery and track-ready capabilities. Additionally, the Targa model reclaimed its admired characteristics, offering a unique combination of style and open-air driving pleasure.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Significantly, the major update during the 991's lifecycle introduced 3-litre flat-six turbo engines across Carrera models, marking a pivotal move towards turbocharged engines for enhanced efficiency and power. This transition ensured that, with the exception of the GT3 and GT3 RS, the prowess of the 911 was now largely derived from forced induction.
        </p>
        <p class ="intro-text">
            The Porsche 991 stands as a milestone in the 911 saga, bridging tradition and innovation while pushing the boundaries of what is expected from a sports car. Its legacy is defined by a blend of aesthetic beauty, technological advancements, and a commitment to exhilarating performance.

        <h1 class="Porsche_Regular">The Porsche 992</h1> <!-- Headings -->
        <h2 class="Porsche_Regular">2018 - 2024</h2> <!-- Subheadings -->

        <p class="intro-text"> <!-- Paragraphs -->
            Units Produced: 96,603 (as of 2022). <br> <br> Unveiled in 2018, the Porsche 992 represents the latest evolution of the iconic 911 series, maintaining its timeless silhouette while introducing significant styling and technological advancements. Among its most striking features is the long light bar at the rear, a design choice that brings a fresh, modern aesthetic to the 992's profile. Additionally, Porsche has updated its performance by extending full track widths to all models, not just those designated for four-wheel-drive and motorsport, enhancing the car's stance and road presence.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            At its launch, the 992 continued to utilize the proven 3-litre flat-six turbo engines found in its predecessor, the 991. However, these engines now boast lower emissions and increased power output, reflecting the brand's commitment to performance and environmental responsibility in equal measure.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Perhaps most intriguingly, the 992 stands on the cusp of a new era for the 911 series, with the potential to introduce hybrid technology. This prospect positions the 992 as a pivotal model in the 911's storied history, blending traditional sports car performance with cutting-edge efficiency and innovation. As such, the Porsche 992 not only upholds the legacy of the 911 but also paves the way for its future, promising an exciting blend of speed, style, and sustainability.
