        <p class="intro-text"> <!-- Paragraphs -->
            Units Produced: 63,762. <br> <br> The Porsche 964, introduced at the tail end of the 1980s, marked a significant leap forward for the iconic 911 series. Despite its mildly updated styling, the 964 was revolutionary, boasting an astounding 85% new technology that propelled the Porsche 911 into a new era of automotive innovation. For the first time, the 964 featured four-wheel drive, alongside other cutting-edge advancements such as power steering, ABS (Anti-lock Braking Systems) brakes, and airbags, enhancing both its performance and safety.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            For years, the 964's design was controversial, often regarded as the least attractive iteration in the 911's storied history, leading to lower prices in the second-hand market. However, perceptions have dramatically shifted. Today, many 964s serve as donor vehicles for highly coveted restorations, and the stripped-out 964 RS, in particular, has seen its value skyrocket. This model is now celebrated as one of the most focused and desirable 911s ever produced, a testament to its enduring appeal and the 911 series' remarkable evolution.

        <h1 class="Porsche_Regular">The Porsche 993</h1> <!-- Headings -->
        <h2 class="Porsche_Regular">1994 - 1998</h2> <!-- Subheadings -->

        <p class="intro-text"> <!-- Paragraphs -->
            Units Produced: 68,881. <br> <br> Introduced in 1994, merely five years after its predecessor, the Porsche 993 is celebrated for encapsulating the quintessence of Porsche's craftsmanship. Esteemed by Porsche enthusiasts as possibly the most beautiful and well-proportioned model in the 911 lineage, the 993 holds a special place in the marque's illustrious history.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Significantly, the 993 stands as the final chapter in the era of air-cooled 911 engines, a poignant farewell to a distinguished technological hallmark that had characterized the series from its inception. Alongside its aesthetic and technical merits, the 993 heralded the introduction of the Porsche GT2, a model that would become legendary for its raw and exhilarating driving experience. The GT2, with its powerful performance and the 911's characteristic rear-engine layout, epitomized the thrilling, tail-happy driving dynamics that earned it the formidable nickname ‘Widow Maker’.
        </p>
        <p class="intro-text">
            The 993 not only advanced the engineering and design ethos of the Porsche 911 but also solidified its legacy, marrying unparalleled beauty with the thrilling performance that continues to define the brand to this day.
